# calibrating-embeddings-for-QA-RAG
In this project, I implemented a method inspired by a Google article to improve embeddings for Q&A in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I used a private dataset (this is a personal project, unrelated to my work at the company). 
Unfortunately, I won’t be sharing the data XD . The embeddings were generated using OpenAI’s small embedding model, and I used an encoder-decoder structure for the implementation.
